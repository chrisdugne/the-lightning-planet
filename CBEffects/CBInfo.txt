ANNOUNCEMENTS

You'll have to just deal without a manual for now - CBResources should be out in a bit.

CBCondensed -
CBCondensed will be published, perhaps two or three updates later. It is a single-file version of CBEffects. It is very slim - only one CBCondensed.lua file, but you don't get any presets with it. So if you're the kind of person who likes to nest files, and doesn't mind if you have no presets, then CBCondensed is for you.


CBText - 
Coming up!

Miscellaneous:

A "bug" is something that generates an error. When a bug occurs, you can't just overlook it. When I write of a "problem", I mean something that goes wrong and fails but you can work around if desired. And an "issue" is just something not so desirable.
